Hello everyone, this is Akhand Pratap Mall and I am here to learn Git and GitHub in a detailed manner.
I am adding more lines to make my second commit and pull these changes to my local repository.
I am adding few more lines from my remote repository to make my third commit and pull these changes to my local repository.
I am adding few more lines for my 6th commit and to learn about merge conflicts.
